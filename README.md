# Avoiding the Great Filter: A Simulation of Important Factors for Human Survival
This repository is a collection of the codes and data that have been implemented in the published study aiming to predict the number of years of survival of mankind on Earth, based on some of the most important factors of massive destruction. All the program files have been written in Python. There are 5 folders, which comprise of the code files and data files (in csv format) for the respective simulations.
